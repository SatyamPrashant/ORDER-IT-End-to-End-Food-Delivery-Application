# ORDER-IT Food Delivery Application

## Overview
This project was developed by me during my internship at Web Stack Academy. This is an end-to-end Food Ordering Web Application built using MERN Stack.

## YouTube Tutorial
Watch my [detailed demonstration on YouTube](https://youtu.be/aiyqyTXEroE?si=LBdNQl4w0E9-GPzC) to get started and learn how to use all the features in the application.

## Key Features
- **Interactive User Interface:** Users can navigate restaurants, add items to cart, sort restaurants according to ratings and reviews and see thier order history.
- **User Registeration and Authentication:** New users can register. Once registered, they can login through their credentials, update their profile and can reset their password if they forget it.
- **Integrated Payment Gateway:** Once orders are placed, the user can checkoout to the payment gateway and can complete their payment by entering their credit card and other details.

## Technology Stack
- **ReactJS:** Creates a user friendly frontend interface, client-side.
- **Node.js:** runtime environment, communicates b/w server and client.
- **Express.js:** web framework to manage the application's data.
- **MongoDB:** stores the database using NoSQL using json files.
